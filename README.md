# QueueProject

## Problem definition

Queueing Models are used to assess the performance of system-level computation. The calculation involves the response time (the execution time plus the waiting time). The program consists of two parts. The first part stands for an individual queue. The second part is for a queue model as a part of a system of queues.

### Part 1

This programming assignment asks you to implement the following cases for each of a single source and for multiple sources. Cases to consider: M/M/1, M,M/n, M/M/n/m where m is larger than n, M/G/1 with given Coefficient of Variation.

### Part 2

Extend the program to include two levels of queues. Input source of the second level is generated as output of queues of first level. Sources of the second level and outputs of the first level are connected via a given probability distribution.
